        <h3>My Software Development Journey</h2>

          <p>
            After arriving in USA, I got a job in amazon wich was and still is my first job but I wanted to go to school just to graduate but the problem was I wasn't sure of which course to take so I started doing my research about high-paying jobs which I found out was Healthcare and IT industry. I decided to start teaching myself java on Youtube but I wasn't getting anywhere, apparently I thought amazon career choices had something for me so I asked my manager and she told me about an IT support program but I didn't want anything other than Java Until this one morning I met my Ugandan friend Trevor who happened to be attending a Data analysis program and he told me he saw a software program so I applied to it and now I'm here.
